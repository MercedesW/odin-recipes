<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A delicious dish inspired by eggs Benedict with mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 English muffin, split</li>
    <li>4 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 tomato, thickly sliced</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons pesto</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
            medium-low, pour in the vinegar and 2 teaspoons of salt, and keep the water at a gentle simmer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>While waiting for the water to simmer, place a slice of mozzarella cheese and a thick slice of tomato onto
            each English muffin half, and toast in a toaster oven until the cheese softens and the English muffin has
            toasted, about 5 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Crack an egg into a small bowl. Holding the bowl just above the surface of the water, gently slip the egg
            into the simmering water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Poach the eggs until the whites are firm and the
            yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted
            spoon, and dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To assemble, place a poached egg on top of each English muffin. Spoon a teaspoon of pesto sauce onto each egg
            and sprinkle with salt to taste.</p>
    </li>
